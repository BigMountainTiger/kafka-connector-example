In Tasks

If the exception is not recoverable (org.apache.kafka.connect.errors.RetriableException),
the task will stop

1. Exception in put() => flush() is still called => Will this commit the offset?
    - Need to make sure the offset is not committed if exception in put()

2. Exception in flush() => stop()
